# Paws&Plates

**Paws&Plates** is a tactical restaurant management game in development with Unity, centered around dispatching staff to time-sensitive tasks across a growing restaurant.

Instead of relying on passive preparation timers as the main interaction, the game turns restaurant operation into an active decision-making system: tasks appear on specific restaurant structures, the player evaluates the demand, assigns employees manually, manages stamina, and expands the restaurant while keeping the operation under control.

## Core Concept

The player manages a restaurant through tactical staff dispatch.

Tasks can represent:

- taking customer orders;
- preparing food;
- cleaning tables;
- washing dishes;
- repairing equipment;
- solving operational issues.

Each task appears as a **TaskPin** over the structure that generated it, such as a table, cashier, grill, oven, sink, or other station.

## Current Gameplay Flow

Current implemented/prototyped flow:

1. A TaskPin spawns over a compatible restaurant structure.
2. The player clicks the TaskPin.
3. The Task Team Selection screen opens.
4. The task timer pauses while the player evaluates the task.
5. The player drags employee cards into task slots.
6. TeamStats updates the selected team’s total attributes.
7. The player dispatches the team.
8. The task enters execution.
9. When execution finishes, the task becomes ready to collect.
10. Clicking the finished TaskPin applies rewards or penalties.

## Main Systems

### Tasks

Tasks are defined through `TaskData`.

Each TaskData can define:

- task name;
- description;
- task type;
- outcome flow;
- expiration time;
- execution time;
- max employee slots;
- difficulty points;
- required attributes;
- stamina cost;
- money reward;
- reputation reward;
- reputation penalty;
- XP rewards;
- task icon and color.

The runtime state of a task is handled separately by `TaskInstance`.

### Task States

Tasks currently support these states:

- Available;
- In Progress;
- Ready To Collect;
- Expired;
- Completed.

### Task Pins

TaskPins are the visual and clickable representation of tasks in the scene.

Current behavior:

- Available tasks count down until expiration.
- Dispatching a team starts execution.
- Execution has its own timer.
- Finished tasks become ready to collect.
- Expired tasks apply penalties when collected.
- Ready tasks apply rewards when collected.

### Task Generator Structures

Tasks spawn on specific restaurant structures.

Each structure can hold only one task at a time.

Examples:

- Cashier → Service tasks;
- Table → Service / Operational tasks;
- Grill / Stove / Oven → Cooking / Operational tasks;
- Sink → Operational tasks.

### Task Team Selection

When the player clicks an available TaskPin, the Task Team Selection screen opens.

It currently supports:

- task name and description display;
- dynamic generation of employee slots based on `TaskData.maxSlots`;
- expanded employee cards;
- drag and drop into task slots;
- TeamStats visual update;
- dispatching selected employees.

### Employees

Employees are defined through ScriptableObjects and have:

- Cooking;
- Service;
- Operational;
- Agility;
- stamina;
- XP;
- level;
- skill points;
- optional trait;
- status icons.

Employee attributes range from 1 to 10.

When employees are assigned to a task, their attributes are summed into team attributes, capped at 10 per attribute.

Example:

- Employee A: Service 6
- Employee B: Service 8
- Team Service: 10

### Employee Cards

There are currently two employee card formats:

- compact cards for normal sidebar display;
- expanded cards for task team selection.

Expanded cards show:

- portrait;
- name;
- level;
- trait;
- stamina;
- XP;
- status icons;
- Cooking;
- Service;
- Operational;
- Agility.

Attributes are displayed as 10-square bars with colored filled squares.

### TeamStats

TeamStats displays the total attributes of the currently selected team during task selection.

It updates whenever a card is placed, removed, or swapped in a task slot.

### Stamina

In the design target, stamina should be consumed when the task result is collected.

In the current prototype, stamina is consumed on Dispatch to validate UI feedback and employee card updates earlier.

### Reputation

Reputation is displayed through a star-based UI with partial progress.

The fill is hidden when:

- reputation is zero;
- reputation is exactly at a star threshold;
- reputation is at maximum.

## Built With

- Unity
- C#
- Unity Input System

- dynamic employee task slots;
- employee drag and drop;
- compact and expanded employee cards;
- visual employee attributes;
- TeamStats attribute display;
- basic reward and penalty collection;
- stamina consumption on dispatch for prototype testing.
